# 📱 OldPhonePad - T9 Text Decoder

This project simulates the behavior of an old cell phone keyboard (T9), allowing to convert a sequence of keys into the corresponding text.

---

## 🧠 How does it work?

- Each number represents a series of letters (e.g. 2 = A/B/C).
- Pressing a key several times chooses a specific letter from that group.
- Using `space` ( ` ` ) indicates a pause between letters of the same button.
- The symbol `*` represents a **backspace**.
- The symbol `#` indicates **send** or end of message.
